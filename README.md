Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room. They currently have a game called Draw It or Lose It for Android. The Gaming Room wanted to improve the software's functionality and expand it to other platforms. I kept this document clear, concise, and to the point. The goal is to enhance the software function of the game "Draw It or Lose It" and make the game available on more platforms beyond Android.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Client-centric focus, stressing that the suggestions are honed to fit the client's particular circumstances, underlines our commitment to their success. It's essential to grasp that each of our clients has individual criteria for what constitutes success, and our research must reflect that diversity. Elimination of bias It is vital to avoid bias in your recommendations. Research and facts: Your suggestions are more persuasive when they are based on well-researched data and information. Motivating comments from the client about the suggestions could be good for business. They enable one to make changes based on the client's input, if necessary, and they serve as a reminder of the collaborative nature of the relationship.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
When you zero in on the crucial tasks, you make better decisions about what also needs to be done and what doesn’t relate to your productivity. You also reduce the chances of going haywire from doing too many things simultaneously. And you just might reduce some stress by not feeling so task-burdened all the time.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Recommendations were hard for me; I knew what was needed and why in my head, but they were hard for me to spell out. Prior to writing, compose a list of your principal thoughts. This will enable you to organize your concepts and verify that you address all vital components. The more you practice writing, the easier it becomes. Try crafting short paragraphs on a variety of subjects to bolster your self-assurance. Utilizing precise and direct language means there is no need to feel obligated to employ sophisticated vocabulary. There were a lot of tutoring sessions and peer-to-peer instruction given. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The mention of the client illustrates the typical business relationship; clients can and do steer a project in the direction they want it to go. However, it is critical to assert that users are the real controllers of the product in the long run. Client trust, user trust, and user satisfaction are prerequisites for a software project's success. If a user has any doubts about the product or the people behind it, that user will not be in the mood to engage or invest in the next round of product development.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
For my project, I focused on clear documentation and the separation of game functionality and game-needs functionality. This kind of structure not only enhances the readability of the code but also makes it easier to update and maintain the project in the future. By structuring it this way, I have also made it easier for myself to identify and modify specific components of the project without affecting the overall system. This separation also allows me to debug much more efficiently and implement new features or make adjustments without disrupting existing functionalities.
